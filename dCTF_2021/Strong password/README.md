# Strong password

## Description

Zip file with a password. I wonder what the password could be?

[Don't use fcrackzip](Don't use fcrackzip)

###### Hint -> Don't use fcrackzip

## Solution

The zip file is protected with a password, let's try to crack it with john the ripper 

First thing let's extract the hash from the file

```console
$ ./zip2john strong_password.zip > strong_password_john
```

Now let's download the [rockyou wordlist](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt), for more possibilities, and try to crack it

```console
$ ./john strong_password_john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format=zip
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (ZIP, WinZip [PBKDF2-SHA1 256/256 AVX2 8x])

Now that we have the password, `Bo38AkRcE600X8DbK3600`, let's extract the file and search for the flag
