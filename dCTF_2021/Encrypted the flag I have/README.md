# Encrypted the flag I have

## Description

Decrypted flag is not in exact format.

## Solution

For this challenge, we receive a picture. Apparently, there is a string of unknown characters. Although, if we pay attention to the title of the challenge, we'll be able to understand that that's a Star Wars reference. 

At this point, we can find on the internet a translator or a human alphabet reference to translate the string.
