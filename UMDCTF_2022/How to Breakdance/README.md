# How to Breakdance

## Description

My friend ctf_playah has been learning to breakdance, can you find his youtube password? Upon submission, wrap his password with UMDCTF{}.

[how_to_breakdance](how_to_breakdance.pcapng)

## Solution

The file contains a usb keyboard caputure, so we can use [this tool](https://github.com/TeamRocketIst/ctf-usb-keyboard-parser) to extract the pressed keys

```console
$ tshark -r how_to_breakdance.pcapng -Y 'usb.capdata && usb.data_len == 8' -T fields -e usb.
capdata | sed 's/../:&/g2' > key

$ python usbkeyboard.py key
