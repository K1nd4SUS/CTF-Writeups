# Wave a flag

###### Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

Let's try to run it and see what happen

```console
$ chmod +x warm 
$ ./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
$ ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
```

#### **FLAG >>** `picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}`
